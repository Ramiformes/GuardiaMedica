# Guardia Médica
# This is my proyect.
## My name and Who I am:
### **I'm Juan Martínez Aguilar, I come from Mexico.**

"Guardia Médica" stands as a testament to the intersection of technology and healthcare. Spearheaded by Juan Martínez Aguilar, a dedicated general practitioner hailing from the diverse terrains of Mexico, this project seeks to cater to a segment often overlooked in the digital realm **– Spanish-speaking doctors**. "Guardia Médica" is a project I'm deeply passionate about. As a general practitioner in Mexico, I found that there were many resources available for doctors in English, but very few tailored to Spanish-speaking doctors like myself. This project, therefore, aims to bridge this gap and provide an invaluable tool to my fellow Spanish-speaking doctors.

In my search for the perfect image to represent the essence of "Guardia Médica," I stumbled upon an intriguing picture on MidJourney. The image instantly captivated me, portraying a character reminiscent of Dr. Goku. For those unfamiliar with the reference, Goku is an iconic figure from popular culture, symbolizing resilience, strength, and dedication. To see him represented in a medical context was not only humorous but also deeply meaningful. It seemed to juxtapose the gravity of the medical profession with the light-heartedness of a beloved character, serving as a beacon of inspiration. Every time I look at it, it serves as a reminder that while our profession is serious, there's always room for joy and inspiration. I truly believe that this image not only adds a touch of humor but also serves as a motivational symbol for those in the medical field.


The primary feature of "Guardia Médica" is its medical calculator. Every single line of the calculator's code was written by me, without the assistance of any API. The calculator is designed to assist doctors during their shifts, offering quick and accurate calculations to aid in decision-making processes. The project structure is relatively simple but effective.
Some of my calculators are: Child Pugh, Body mass index, count of eosinofils, predicted weight, weeks of gestation (in pregnant women),sledai (for rheumatology patients), sodium corrected by glucose, corporal surface.
Inside the "static" folder, there's a picture used for the design, along with two vital files: scripts.js and styles.css. I must admit, JavaScript was a challenging area for me, particularly since it felt like a topic that wasn't explored in-depth during my learning. Yet, overcoming these challenges has been incredibly rewarding.
Inside of the folder called "static" I have a picture I used, my scripts.js and my styles.css. I struggled a lot with the javascript, since I felt that it was one of the shortest topics.

#### Other key features:

Another key feature I implemented is the styles.html. This was designed to ensure consistency in styling across different parts of the webpage without redundant code. The most daunting challenge I encountered was integrating the calculators coded in Python with the front-end. Although it was a tumultuous journey—filled with moments of frustration—it was equally thrilling and gratifying.

#### Lastly, I would like to mention that this isn't the final version of "Guardia Médica". My vision is to continue refining it and ultimately secure a domain for it, ensuring that more and more Spanish-speaking doctors can benefit from this tool.
#### I coded all the calculator by myself, I didn't use any API.
I plan on taking the CS50 web dev with python and javascript.
